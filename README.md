# Maze solver
Given a two - dimensional matrix representing a maze with a single arbitrary
starting and ending point, as well as an arbitrary number of wall blocks, you
are required to produce an application that will output an actorâ€™s route in the
form of two - dimensional points from start to finish.

# Instructions
Once you clone the repository you'll find ```main.rb , maze.rb``` and three maze samples ```maze1.txt, maze2.txt, maze3.txt```. 
Run ```ruby main.rb``` and follow the instructions.

# Algorithm used
I used the **Breadth First Search** algorithm in order to find the way out of the maze.
